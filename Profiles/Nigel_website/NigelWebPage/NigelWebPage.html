I have two dogs, they are both Corgies. Their names are Snoop and Meapo (I call her Stink). During peach season I make peach cobbler every week, that is assuming that yellow peaches have been purchace from the store. I am indeed quite fond of baking, cooking, reading, gaming, and drawing. I am still learing the fundamentals of drawing and I offten lament that I should have started drawing when I started baking.

It is going to be Halloween soon, the perfect time to watch scary movies. When it comes to movie night I seem to be the only one in my family that will choose a horror movie, this leads to me picking out a horror movie each movie night. I have a list of movies I want to watch and that list it mostly composed of horror movies. I never did beat Dark Souls, yet Solaire of Astora is my profile picture. I have beaten all the other Soulsborne games FromSoft has made.
