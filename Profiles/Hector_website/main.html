                Hello, my name is Hector Romero, and I am a computer science student at the University of Houston-Downtown, with the goal of becoming a software engineer or work in the cybersecurity field.
                I am an ambitious individual with a responsible approach to every task I undertake and every situation I encounter.
                I thrive on success, regardless of the task's difficulty. As a college student, I excel at collaborating with others to achieve objectives on time and to the highest standards of excellence.
                I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge in the field of computer science. In my free time, I like to spend time with my girlfriend and go out to the movies with her.
                Recently, I have been getting back into Pokémon card collecting, something I did as a kid, but it's been hard trying to get cards since many people like to resell Pokémon products.
                I've been doing a lot of LeetCode practice and behavioral interview prep to help me prepare for job interviews. During the summer, I have a goal of hopefully landing a summer internship.
                I also want to build a gaming PC so that I can start gaming. I also have dreams of doing something on social media as well as starting my own clothing brand.
